# Data_Course_SPENCERThis README file contains information about my uploaded assignments
This is the second line added to README
Can I use \n to add a new line?
Oops I meant to name that last commit '3rd commit'
But I guess I should have just did '4th commit' and the last one was supposed to be '5th commit'
Oh well. 7th commit right now
Adding something to README
I think I have this down
I am done with this assignment
This edit was done through VS Code
